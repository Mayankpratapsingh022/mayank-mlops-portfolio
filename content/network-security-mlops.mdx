# Network Security - Malicious URL Detection using MLOps üöÄ



This project delivers an end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** for detecting malicious URLs using **machine learning**. By integrating tools like **XGBoost**, **FastAPI**, **Airflow**, and **AWS**, it provides **real-time predictions** and **batch processing**, ensuring user safety with a robust and scalable solution.

---

## üåü **Highlights**

- **Single and Batch Predictions**: 
   - **Streamlit UI** for single URL predictions.
   - **FastAPI** backend for batch predictions via CSV uploads.
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Includes data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, and deployment.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, containerization, and deployment to **AWS EC2**.
- **Orchestration with Airflow**: DAGs for automated training and batch prediction pipelines.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: **MLflow** for tracking metrics and **AWS S3** for artifact storage.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f1b37a7-d64e-40f4-9750-42ec43dcc972)

The pipeline follows a modular design:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Data fetched from MongoDB and validated.
2. **Model Training**: XGBoost classifier trained and tracked using MLflow.
3. **Deployment**: Dockerized and deployed to AWS EC2 with artifacts stored in S3.
4. **Monitoring**: Automated retraining pipelines via Airflow.

---

## üß™ **Key Features**

1. **Real-Time Predictions**: Use the Streamlit UI for instant URL assessments.
2. **Batch Predictions**: Upload CSV files via FastAPI to predict multiple URLs.
3. **Model Retraining**: Automated Airflow pipelines ensure the model stays updated.
4. **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions builds, tests, and deploys the application.
5. **AWS Integration**: S3 for storage, ECR for Docker images, and EC2 for hosting.
